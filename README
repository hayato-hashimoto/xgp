==Goal==

This library aims to provide a manipulative model for a labled directed graph,
as an alternative for SEXP, XML, or RDF.

==Symposis==

 * Every node and edge has a label. A label is a Scheme object.
 * Sibling nodes are stored in their order.
 * Unlike SEXPs and XMLs, a node can have more than one nodes as its parents.
